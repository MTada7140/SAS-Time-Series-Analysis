# 1.Preparation for time series analysis 

## 1-1.Software
###   Surprisingly, since 2016, SAS software can be used free of charge for learning purpose. You can download and install the required software from this URL(https://www.sas.com/en_nz/software/university-edition/download-software.html). The initial panel of "SAS University Edition" looks like this.

### You can submit any program you like from the program window and get output on the result window(in html format).

### Also, you can have a look at the ordinary SAS log on the log window.

## 1-2.Getting the data
### In this article, I'd like to use a 'real' data published on the web site. I found a monthly data of passengers from this site(http://new.censusatschool.org.nz/resource/time-series-data-sets-2013/).
### The data is organised in the form of csv file and look like this.
